Software needed: Python version 3.x, Eclipse or Atom

How to run the simulator on your computer:

1) Create a repository on GitHub

2) Go to the Roomba repository and click the green Clone or Download button in the top right. Copy the web URL.

3) Open Terminal

4) Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made (this method will vary between operating systems)

5) Type “git clone “ and then past the URL you copied in Step 2.

6) Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

7) If you do not already have the numpy and easgui libraries installed, use pip (or pip3 depending on your python version) to install then: "pip3 install easygui", "pip3 install numpy".

8) Navigate to your cloned directory in your development environment (i.e. Eclipse/Atom) and run Roomba.py

9) Everything from then on should be self-explanatory; refer to in-line comments in the code for further explanation.
